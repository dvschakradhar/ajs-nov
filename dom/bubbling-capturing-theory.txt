In general, when an event occurs on  an  element, the corresponding event listener will respond.

This happens because of event propogation.

There are different phases of how this event propogation happens

1. Event capturing
2. Event
3. Event bubbling


Event capturing is top down
It is proposed by Netscape

Event bubbling is the concept of the event bubbling from the target or innermost to 
parents

Event bubbling is prpoposed by Microsoft

These are the 2 different schools of thought.

w3c - (world web consortium) came saying we will support both. THe developers can choose at which phase 
they want to listen to the event.

They said Event bubbling is the default behavior

addEventListener('click', callback function, true of false)
by default the 3rd inoput is false for event bubbling
true is for event capturing
